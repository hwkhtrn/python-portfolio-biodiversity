# Introduction

Analyzing biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, specifically about different species seen in various national park locations, is the aim of this study.

The scope, analysis, preparation, plotting, and explanation of the analysis's results will all be part of this project.

This initiative has attempted to provide answers to the following questions:

+ What is the distribution of a species' conservation status?
+ Do some species have a higher risk of being endangered than others?
+ Are there notable discrepancies in the conservation status of different species?
+ Which animal is most common, and how are they distributed throughout the parks?

**Data sources:**

`species_info.csv` and `observations.csv` were both supplied by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).

Note: Although primarily fictional, the data used in this project is *inspired* by actual data.
